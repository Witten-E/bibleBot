# What is BibleBot

BibleBot is a bot for CSH Slack that fact checks people when they say "none of those words were in the bible" or similar phrases. The logic and the bot are both written in Python with the bot using [Python Slack SDK](https://tools.slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/). The bot is hosted in a Docker container.




Because I'm bad at git things, this repo did not exist for a while while I was working on the project because I was working out of an outdated repo with my old name attached to it, so apologies for lack of historical evidence.
